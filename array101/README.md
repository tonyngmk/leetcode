### 4. Duplicate Zeros
- File: `duplicate_zeros.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3245/
- Description: Duplicate zeros in array, shifting non-zero elements to the right.
- Pattern: To use break to maintain array length. To have 2 pointers for writing and referencing value.

### 5. Merge Sorted Array
- File: `merge_sorted_array.py`

- Difficulty: 2/10

### 8. Check if N and its double exists
- File: `check_if_n_and_its_double_exists.py`

- Description: Check if both N and 2N exists in an array. 
- Pattern: Loop through array. Create a new hash map to store elements that you have "seen". If current iteration's value divided by 2 or multiplication of 2 value exists in "seen" map, returns True. Else, store current iteration value into hash map.
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(n), 1 pass
- Space: O(n), new hash map
- Difficulty: 1/10

### 9. Valid Mountain Array
- File: `valid_mountain_array.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/527/searching-for-items-in-an-array/3251/
- Description: A valid mountain array is one where array starts from 0, continues to a peak without duplicates, and goes down to 0 without duplicates.
- Pattern: Create 2 pointers. Left and right pointers can only move towards their opposite directions if the next element is greater than their current position. Both will end at the same peak (index) if array is a valid mountain.
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
- Difficulty: 2/10

### 10. Replace element with greatest elements on right side
- File: `replace_element_with_greatest_elements_on_right_side.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3259/
- Description: Given an array, replace each index with the max value on its right.
- Pattern: To start from the right. Current iteration calculates for next iteration. Calculation is max(max_int, current iteration). Replace current index with calculation of previous value.
- Edge case: NIL.
- Time: O(n), 1 pass.
- Space: O(1), in place operation with only 1 constant created
- Difficulty: 2/10

- Description: Move zeros of array into end while preserving relative order
- Pattern: Iterate throughout array, create another write pointer. If read pointer value not 0, then swap write and read pointer simultaneously.
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(N), 1 pass.
- Space: O(1), in place array operation.
- Difficulty: 2/10

### 12. Sort Array by Parity
- File: `sort_array_by_parity.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3260/
- Description: Move even numbers forward
- Pattern: Same with #11, just change condition for 0 to even numbers
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(N), 1 pass.
- Space: O(1), in place array operation.
- Difficulty: 2/10

### 13. Height Checker 
- File: `height_checker.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/523/conclusion/3228/
- Description: Sort array by ascending, count the amount of times required for swap.
- Pattern: Counting sort. Loop one pass to create a count-sort array. With count-sort array, loop through original array, if existing index of counting-sort array is not 0 and value of original array is not the same as index of counting-sort array, that index should not have that value (if it was sorted in the first place).
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(N), 2 pass, 1 to create count-sort array, 1 more to find amount of differences.
- Space: O(n), 1 more counting-sort array to be created.

- Description: Given a binary array, flip at most one time 0 to find the maximum consecutive range of 1s.
- Pattern: Approach 1 is to max the sum of count of contiguous previous and current "1s" spaced by one 0. Approach 2 implements the sliding window with conditions that states valid and invalid windows, finding max length of window in each iteration.
- Edge case: NIL
- Time: O(n), 1 pass.
