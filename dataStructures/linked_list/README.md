### 1. Intro - Design Linked List
- File: `design_linked_list.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/209/singly-linked-list/1290/
- Description: Implement class and methods for linked list.
- Pattern: NIL
- Difficulty: 5/10. Not easy to code from understanding, to revisit this.

### 2. Linked list cycle I 
- File: `linked_list_cycle.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/214/two-pointer-technique/1212/
- Description: Use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to determine if linked list is a cycle when both slow and fast pointer intersect.
- Pattern: Implement Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
- Difficulty: 3/10. 
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### 3. Linked list cycle II 
- File: `linked_list_cycle_2.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/214/two-pointer-technique/1214/
- Description: Use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to determine if linked list is a cycle. If so, create 2 more pointers at head and intersection and traverse till both meets, that is guaranteed to be the entrance.
- Pattern: Implement Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
- Difficulty: 4/10, to revisit without help again. 
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### 6. Remove linked list elements
- File: `remove_linked_list_elements.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/
- Description: Remove linked list element if node has certain value.
- Pattern: Add Sentinel node to help return head value
- Difficulty: 1/10, but revisit without help again.
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### 7. Odd even linked list
- File: `odd_even_linked_list.py`
- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/
- Description: Group odd indices nodes, then even indices nodes, and return them in a linked-list inplace  
- Pattern: 
- Difficulty: 3/10, but revisit without help again.
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
